# STI Electronic Disciplinary Office Software
The STI Electronic Disciplinary Office Software is a sophisticated solution designed to streamline the management of student violations and permits, providing both students and teachers with a seamless tracking system.

## Project Background and Purpose
If you don't know me, my name is Iommi Mandela, and I am a recent graduate of STI College Fairview (July 27, 2023) and I am the one who made this project possible. This project serves as the culmination of my group's thesis capstone project. The motivation behind the creation of this software was rooted in the observation that a significant number of students within our institution were grappling with the challenges of efficiently tracking their school violations. The existing paper-based approach to managing these infractions was cumbersome and prone to errors. In response, my team and I undertook the task of devising a more effective solution. This software stands as the outcome of our dedication to resolving this pressing issue.
